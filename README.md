# Binary Search - The Ultimate Guide

## üîç What is Binary Search?
Binary Search is a searching algorithm that works on a sorted array by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half. It has a time complexity of **O(log N)**.

## üöÄ Types of Binary Search
1. **Standard Binary Search** (Finding an element in a sorted array)
2. **Lower Bound** (First occurrence of an element or smallest number >= target)
3. **Upper Bound** (Smallest number strictly greater than the target)
4. **Finding First & Last Occurrence of an Element**
5. **Binary Search on Answer** (Finding minimum/maximum possible value)
6. **Binary Search on Floating Points** (Precision-based binary search)
7. **Binary Search on Bitmasks & States** (Advanced use cases)

## üõ†Ô∏è Different Ways to Find Mid
### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Standard Formula
```cpp
int mid = (low + high) / 2;
```
‚úÖ Simple & readable, ‚ùå Can cause overflow when `low + high` exceeds `INT_MAX`.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Safe Formula (Preferred)
```cpp
int mid = low + (high - low) / 2;
```
‚úÖ Prevents overflow, recommended in most cases.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Biased Mid Towards `low`
```cpp
int mid = low + (high - low + 1) / 2;
```
‚úÖ Useful when the answer tends towards `high` (e.g., finding the last occurrence of an element).

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Bitwise Operation (Fastest & Safe)
```cpp
int mid = (low & high) + ((low ^ high) >> 1);
```
‚úÖ Prevents overflow, ‚úÖ Faster bitwise computation, ‚ùå Less readable for beginners.

## üìå Important Binary Search Patterns & Problems

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Classic Binary Search**
Find an element in a sorted array.
- **Example:** [Search in Rotated Sorted Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/search-in-rotated-sorted-array/)

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **First & Last Occurrence**
Use binary search twice to find first and last positions.
- **Example:** [Find First and Last Position of Element](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-first-and-last-position-of-element-in-sorted-array/)

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Binary Search on Answer**
Used when answer lies in a range and we need to optimize it.
- **Example:** [Capacity to Ship Packages in D Days](https://leetcode.com/problems/capacity-to-ship-packages-within-d-days/)
- **Example:** [Koko Eating Bananas](https://leetcode.com/problems/koko-eating-bananas/)

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ **Lower Bound & Upper Bound**
- **Lower Bound:** Smallest index where `arr[i] >= target`
- **Upper Bound:** Smallest index where `arr[i] > target`
- **Example:** [Find Smallest Letter Greater Than Target](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-smallest-letter-greater-than-target/)

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ **Binary Search on Floating Points**
Used when searching with precision.
- **Example:** [Nth Root of a Number](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/n-th-root-number/)

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ **Binary Search on 2D Matrix**
Used in searching within a sorted matrix.
- **Example:** [Search a 2D Matrix](https://leetcode.com/problems/search-a-2d-matrix/)

### 7Ô∏è‚É£ **Binary Search with Monotonic Functions**
Used when a function's output is monotonic.
- **Example:** [Minimize Maximum Distance to Gas Station](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimize-max-distance-to-gas-station/)

### 8Ô∏è‚É£ **Binary Search in Infinite Array**
If an array is infinitely long, expand search range exponentially.
- **Example:** [Search in Infinite Sorted Array](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-position-element-sorted-array-infinite-numbers/)
